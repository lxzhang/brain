Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability,
the analysis of random phenomena. The central objects of probability theory 
are random variables, stochastic processes, and events: mathematical abstractions 
of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single 
occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion. 
If an individual coin toss or the roll of dice is considered to be a random event,
 then if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain
 patterns, which can be studied and predicted. 
 Two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are 
 **the law of large numbers** and **the central limit theorem**.
 
As a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential 
to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data.
 Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems 
 given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics. 
 A great discovery of twentieth century physics was the probabilistic nature 
 of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics.




## **Probability distribution**

### Terminology

* **Probability mass**, [Probability mass function][pmf], **`p.m.f.`**: for discrete random variables.

* **Categorical distribution**: for discrete random variables with a finite set of values.
* **Probability density**, [Probability density function][pdf], **`p.d.f.`**: most often reserved for continuous random variables.
