Leonhard Euler (/ˈɔɪlər/ oy-lər;) (15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783) was a pioneering **Swiss mathematician and physicist**. He made important discoveries in fields as diverse as infinitesimal calculus and graph theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function. He is also renowned for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory.

Euler is considered to be the **pre-eminent mathematician of the 18th century** and one of the greatest mathematicians to have ever lived. He is also one of the most prolific mathematicians; his collected works fill 60–80 [quarto（四开）] volumes. He spent most of his adult life in St. Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, Prussia.

A statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses Euler's influence on mathematics:"*Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.*"
