Citation Signal
===============

Introductory signals are used in **legal** citations to present authorities and 
show how the authorities relate to propositions in textual statements. 
Legal writers use introductory signals to tell readers how their citations 
to legal authority support, or do not support, their written propositions. 
Introductory signals organize the writer's citations into a hierarchy 
of strength and importance so that the reader can quickly determine 
the relative weight of the citation. For example, the introductory signal "See" 
tells the reader that the cited authority either (a) supports 
the stated proposition implicitly, or (b) contains dicta that support 
the proposition. "But see," on the other hand, tells the reader that the cited 
authority either (a) contradicts the stated proposition implicitly, or 
(b) contains dicta that contradict the stated proposition.

Introductory signals have different meanings 
in different U.S. citation style systems. 
The two most prominent citation manuals are 
*The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation* and *the ALWD Citation Manual*. 
Some state-specific style manuals also provide guidance on legal citation. 
The Bluebook citation system is both the most comprehensive and 
most widely used system by courts, law firms, and law reviews. 
Here are examples, with explanations, of the introductory signals used 
in legal writing under the Bluebook system


### Signals that indicate support

***\[no signal\]***

When writers use no signal, this tells readers that the cited authority directly 
states the proposition, is the source of the cited quotation, or 
identifies an authority referred to in the text.

***e.g.***

Latin phrase "exempli gratia," means "for example." It tells the reader that 
what the writer is citing directly supports the proposition but 
there are other authorities which also support the proposition, 
but their citation may not be as useful or necessary. 
This introductory signal may be used in combination with other signals, 
preceded by an italicized comma. Note: the comma after *e.g.*, is not italicized 
when attached to another signal (whether supportive or not), 
but is italicized when e.g. appears alone.

Example: Other circuits have made that leap. *See, e.g.*, *Arnold*, 421 F.3d at 870 & n.1 (Callahan, J., dissenting)

***Accord***

"Accord" is used when two or more sources state or support the proposition, 
but the text quotes or refers to only one; the other sources are then introduced 
by "accord." In other words, accord means “I just cited something that supports 
my proposition, and now here’s another thing that supports it too.” 
Legal writers often use accord to show that the law of one jurisdiction is 
in accord with that of another jurisdiction.

Example: The primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, 
but "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." Art.I, 8, cl. 8; 
*accord Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken*, 422 U.S. 151, 156 (1975).

***See***

“See” indicates that the cited authority clearly supports, but 
not directly states the proposition given. Used instead of \[no signal\], 
to indicate that the proposition follows from the cited authority. 
There is an inferential step between the authority cited and 
the proposition it supports. 

"See" may also be used to refer to a cited authority that contains dicta(权威的断言) 
in support of the proposition being made.

Example: Similar questions have arisen under the federal endangered Species Act. 
*See, e.g.*, *United States v. Winnie*, 97 F.3d 975 (7th Cir. 1996).

***See also***

This indicates that the cited authority constitutes additional material 
that supports the proposition. The cited authority supports the proposition 
with which the citation is associated, but less directly 
than that indicated by "see" or "accord." 
"See also" may be used to introduce a case that supports the stated proposition, 
but is somehow distinguishable from previously cited cases. 
"See also" is sometimes used to refer readers to authorities that 
support a proposition when other authorities that support the proposition 
have already been cited or discussed. The use of a parenthetical explanation of 
the sources relevance following a citation introduced by "see also" is also encouraged.

Example: In *Ash*, the disabled student attended private school beginning in 1983, 
but his parents did not provide meaningful notice to the school district until 1989. 
*Ash v. Lake Oswego Sch. Dist. No. 7J*, 766 F.Supp. 852, 853-55, 864 (D.Or.1991); 
*see also Ash*, 980 F.2d at 586 (incorporating the district court's account of the facts).

***Cf***

This signals (for the Latin confer, meaning "compare") that the cited authority 
states a proposition different from the main proposition 
but sufficiently analogous to lend support. Writers use this signal 
when the cited authority doesn’t exactly support what they just said, 
but it’s close enough to lend support. An explanatory parenthetical is strongly 
recommended, otherwise the citation's relevance may not be clear to the reader.

Example: It would be destructive of time and energy for all concerned 
were we to rule otherwise. *Cf. Doe v. Bolton*, 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201.


### Signals that indicate background material

***See generally***

This signal indicates that the cited authority presents helpful background material 
related to the proposition. Legal scholars generally encourage 
the use of parenthetical explanations of the source material's relevance 
following each authority, using 'see generally.' 
A writer can use this signal with both primary and secondary sources.

Example: *See generally Gonzalez v. Whitney & Rainey*, 288 S.W. 45, 48 (Tex. 1972).



### Signals that indicate contradiction

***Contra***

This signals that the cited authority directly contradicts a given point: opposition. 
*Contra* is used where "[no signal]" would be used for support.

Example: *Contra, ante*, at 690-691.

***But see***

Cited authority either contradicts the stated proposition implicitly or 
contains dicta that contradict the stated proposition. 
But see is used where "see" would be used for support.

Example: "Specifically, under *Roberts*, there may have been cases 
in which courts erroneously determined that testimonial statements were reliable. 
*But see Bockting v. Bayer*, 418 F.3d at 1058 (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)."

***But cf.***

Cited authority contradicts the stated proposition by analogy. The use of 
a parenthetical explanation of the source's relevance is strongly recommended.


"But" should be omitted from "but see" and "but cf." 
whenever one of these signals follows another negative signal:

Example: We caution, however, that our analysis might have been different 
if Lanciloti had shown that anyone had been excluded from jury service 
by the way the boundaries had been drawn (for example, to save the cost 
of reimbursing mileage) or if he had been tried, over objection, before 
a jury drawn from a district other than where the crime was alleged to 
have been committed, or if the clear legislative purpose had not been to 
create a broader and more representative jury pool. But cf. Laws Of 2005, 
ch. 199, § 1.



### Signals that indicate a useful comparison

***Compare ... with ... ***

* [ ] todo



### Using signals as verbs

In footnotes, signals may function as verbs in textual sentences. 
This allows material that would otherwise be included in a parenthetical explanation 
to be more cohesively integrated. When used in this manner, 
signals should not be italicized.

For Example: 

> *See* Christina L. Anderson, Comment, 
> *Double Jeopardy: The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice*, 
> 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004) 
> (discussing four main types of restorative justice programs).

Becomes:

> See Christina L. Anderson, Comment, 
> *Double Jeopardy: The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice*, 
> 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004), for a discussion of restorative justice 
> as a reasonable replacement for retributive sanctions.

"Cf." becomes "compare" and "e.g." becomes "for example" 
when these signals are used as verbs.



### Signal formatting

**Capitalizing Signals**

The first letter of a signal should be capitalized when it begins a citation sentence. 
However, if the signal is within a citation clause or appears 
within a citation sentence, it should not be capitalized.

**Signal Placement and Typeface**

One space should separate an introductory signal from the rest of the citation, 
with no punctuation in between.

Example: *See American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA*, 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

Do not italicize a signal if it is being used as a verb.

Example: For a discussion of the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to 
interpret a statute to provide intelligible principles, 
see *American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA*, 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).
