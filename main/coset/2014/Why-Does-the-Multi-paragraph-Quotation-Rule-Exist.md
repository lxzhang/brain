Why does the multi-paragraph quotation rule exist?
==================================================

### Question

The answer to this question clearly explains the standard rule that
when you have multiple quoted paragraphs, 
**each** new paragraph starts with an opening quotation mark, 
**but only the final** quoted paragraph has a closing quotation mark at its end.

This [Wikipedia article on Quotation Marks][01] agrees:

> Quotation marks are used for multiple-paragraph quotations
> in some cases, especially in narratives.
> The convention in English is to give opening quotation marks 
> to the first and each subsequent paragraph, 
> using closing quotation marks only for the final paragraph of the quotation 

However, neither explains **why** this is the standard practice. 
What good does it do? 
What is it trying to avoid? 
What harm would occur if it were ignored and 
people put both opening and closing quotation marks 
on each adjacent quoted paragraph?

简单地中文解释：
为什么用双引号引用的时候，在每个段落开头用`“`，
但是在几个段落最后才用 `”`？


### Answer

“That seems like an odd way to use punctuation,” Tom said. “What harm would there be in using quotation marks at the end of every paragraph?”

“Oh, that’s not all that complicated,” J.R. answered. “If you closed quotes at the end of every paragraph, then you would need to reidentify the speaker with every subsequent paragraph.

“Say a narrative was describing two or three people engaged in a lengthy conversation. If you closed the quotation marks in the previous paragraph, then a reader wouldn’t be able to easily tell if the previous speaker was extending his point, or if someone else in the room had picked up the conversation. By leaving the previous paragraph’s quote unclosed, the reader knows that the previous speaker is still the one talking.”

“Oh, that makes sense. Thanks!”

一个例子：


~~~
他站起来，对她说

“很好”

“但是”
~~~
（这样无法区分是谁说的“但是”）


~~~
他站起来，对她说

“很好。

“但是”
~~~
（这样你就知道，分段是停顿，他还没说完）



P.S. 解决了我多年的疑惑，小学的时候就问过语文老师，无解。
