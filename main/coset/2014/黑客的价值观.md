### The Hacker's Code

> "A hacker of the Old Code."

* Hackers come and go, but a great hack is forever.
* Public goods belong to the public.
* Software hoarding is evil.
  Software does the greatest good given to the greatest number.
* Don't be evil.
* Sourceless software sucks.
* People have rights.
  Organizations live on sufferance(容许).
* Governments are organizations.
* If it is wrong when citizens do it,
  it is wrong when governments do it.
* Information wants to be free.
  Information *deserves* to be free.
* Being legal doesn't make it right.
* Being illegal doesn't make it wrong.
* Subverting tyranny is the highest duty.
* Trust your technolust!


### The Hacker's Code of Ethics

Levy (1984) suggests that there is a "code of ethics" for hacking which, though not pasted on the walls, is in the air:

* Access to Computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.


### *DRAFT* The Hacker's Code *DRAFT*

Preamble: We, the people of the electronic universe, in order to establish a society of knowledge and skills, do hereby proclaim the following.

* Hackers are diverse, from all cultures and backgrounds. Every hacker is unique, yet we all share some characteristics. While not every hacker follows this Code, many believe it is a fair description of our shared traditions, goals and values.
* Hackers share and are willing to teach their knowledge
* Hackers are skilled. Many are self-taught, or learn by interacting with other hackers.
* Hackers seek knowledge. This knowledge may come from unauthorized or unusual sources, and is often hidden.
* Hackers are tinkerers. They like to understand how things work, and want to make their own improvements or modifications.
* Hackers often disagree with authority, including parents, employers, social customs and laws. They often seek to circumvent authority they disagree with.
* Hackers disagree with each other. Different hackers have different values, and come from all backgrounds. This means that what one hacker is opposed to might be embraced by another.
* Hackers are persistent, and are willing to devote hours, days and years to pursuing their individual passions.
* This Code is not to prescribe how hackers act. Instead, it is to help us to recognize our own diversity and identify.
* Every hacker must make his or her own decisions about what is right or wrong, and some might do things they believe are illegal, amoral or anti-social to achieve higher goals.
* Hackers' motivations are their own, and there is no reason for all hackers to agree.
* Hackers have a shared identify, however, and many shared interests.
* By reading this Code, hackers can recognize themselves and each other, and understand better the group they are a part of. This will be beneficial to all hackers.

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
