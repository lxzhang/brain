Etymology of Mathematical Terms
-------------------------------


### Why is that?

引用 Joseph J. Rotman 的
[*The First Course in Abstract Algebra with Applications*][douban-abstract-algebra]：

> Giving the etymology of mathematical terms is rarely done. Let me explain,
> with an analogy, why I have included derivations of many terms. There are many
> variations of standard poker games and, in my poker group, the dealer announces 
> the game of his choice by naming it. Now some names are better than others.
> For example, "Little Red" is a game in which one's smallest red card is wild; this
> is a good name because it reminds the players of its distinctive feature. On the 
> other hand, "Aggravation" is not such a good name, for thought it is, indeed, 
> suggestive, the name does not distinguish this particular game from several others.
> Most terms in mathematics have been well chosen; there are more red names than
> aggravating ones. An example of a good name is *even* permutation, for a permutation
> is even if it is a product of an even number of transpositions. Another
> example of a good term is the *parallelogram law* describing vector addition. But
> many good names, clear when they were chosen, are now obscure because their
> roots are either in another language or in another discipline. The trigonometric
> terms *tangent* and *secant* are good names for those knowing some Latin, but
> they are obscure otherwise. 
> The term *mathematics* is obscure only because most of us do not know that it comes
> from the classical Greek word meaning "to learn". The term *corollary* is doubly
> obscure; it comes from the Latin word meaning "flower", but why should some
> theorems be called flowers? A plausible explanation is that it was common, in
> ancient Rome, to give flowers as gifts, and so a corollary is a gift bequeathed by
> a theorem. The term *theorem* comes from the Greek word meaning "to watch"
> or "to contemplate" (*theatre* has the same root); it was used by Euclid with its
> present meaning. The term *lemma* comes from the Greek word meaning "taken"
> or "received"; it is a statement that is taken for granted (for it has already been
> proved) in the course of proving a theorem. **I believe that etymology of terms
> is worthwhile (and interesting!), for it often aids understanding by removing 
> unnecessary obscurity.**
