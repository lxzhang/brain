1. 

> a permutation alpha = tau_1*tau_2*...*tau_n; tau <==> transposition

**Tau == Transposition**

2. 

** *m*: move, *u*, *d*, *l*, *r*, for up, down, left, right, respectively **
 
> Each simple move takes `#`(一个棋子) up, down, left, or right.
> Thus the total number *m* of moves is *u*+*d*+*l*+*r*.


3.  

** *G*: Group, *e*: element **

> A group is a set *G* equipped with an operation `*` and
> a special element *e* <belong-to> *G*, called the identity, such that...


4. 

** delta(uppercase)= ad - bc = det(A) **

5. 

** S: the **S**ymmetry Group, the **S**ub set**


6. 

> The symmetry group <Sigma>(<Omega>) of a figure <Omega> in the plane is
> the set of all isometries <phi> of the plane with <phi>(<Omega>) = <Omega>.
> The elements of <sigma>(<omega>) are called symmetries of <Omega>. p 140

注意 <sigma>(**S**igma) 和 **S**ymmetry.

7. 

> The group <Sigma>(<pi>_4) is called the dihedral group with 8 elements,
> and it is denoted by D_8.

8. 

> The symmetryi gorup <Sigma>(<pi>_n) of a regular polygon <pi_n> with center at O
> and vertices v_0, v_1, ..., v_{n-1} is called the dihedral group D_{2n}.
